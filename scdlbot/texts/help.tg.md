Hi! I download and send audios from videos/tracks/sets/albums in *MP3 128 kbps* with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to Telegram Bot API limit.

â€¢How to use?
There are Mainly two ways to use this bot.

First Way is to directly send the link of the music and press on the "Download" button.

Second Way is to type '@vid search the song which you want and select it' our bot will detect the song from the url and will give you a button of download.
